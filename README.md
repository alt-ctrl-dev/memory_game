# Sequence memory game
The player has to pick the correct items in the order shown

## Introduction
Welcome to the Letgo Fullstack technical test!

For this test we want to see your skills and knowledge by developing a small and fun game: **Sequence memory game**.

We expect from you clean and well structured code.

## The Game
Each round adds one random item to the end of the sequence. When the sequence is finished the player has to click on the items in the order shown to pass to the next round.

#### Example
We have 4 items, lets say: **Dog, Cat, Horse and Frog**:
* the **first round Cat is highlighted** and the **user should click on Cat** to pass to the next round.
* for the **second round Cat is highlighted and then Dog**, so the **user should click on Cat and then Dog**.
* for the **third round Cat is highlighted, then Dog and then Cat again** (because it is random, so items can be repeated), so the **user should click on Cat, then Dog and then Cat again** to pass to the next round.

## Requirements
You should use this project to develop your solution and use **React with Redux** (they are added in `package.json` file along with **redux-thunk, react-dom, and react-redux**)

For us is important that the candidates have **strong styling knowledge** so we expect from you an **attractive and responsive** solution (no ui frameworks like bootstrap, material-ui...)

You can use your favourite style library/preprocessor such a **less, stylus, sass or any CSS-in-JS**...we use **[styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)**. Bear in mind that depending on the tool you choose you may need to add some configuration to the **webpack.config.js** file.

The **items should be fetched from a public API** like [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/). You can find many of them in the following repository: [Public APIs list](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis).

The API chosen should allow you to **fetch a specific number of items**. For example, with the **pokeapi** you can call `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=9` which returns the first 9 pokemon. The number of items is up to you, but should be more than 3. You can use your favourite **library for fetching data**. We use **[axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)**.

**[Javascript standard style](https://standardjs.com/)** is also installed and it will be run each time you commit something. We want to see how you adapt your code by working with a different style guide.

## Bonus
* Data from **multiple APIs** and combining them (For example, combine pokemon API with Marvel API to show pokemons and Marvel characters)
* Animations
* Sounds
* Server side rendering
* Unit tests

Additional features are very welcome :)

## How to deliver
Compress your solution (without the `/node_modules` and `/build` folders) and send us the zip file

## How to run the project
* Install the dependencies by running `yarn install`
* Launch dev server by running `yarn start`
* To create the production bundle just run `yarn build`

If for your final solution we need to run something else (like `yarn test` for unit testing for example) please add it here :)
